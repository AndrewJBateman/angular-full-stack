# AngularFullStack

Sets up a Node server application using TypeScript directly within the same folder as an Angular CLI application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

## Notes

Working - a post request to http://localhost:4201/users/ is echoed back, as can be seen using Chrome Dev Tools Network - Name (users).The single command to start both frontend and backend does not work. I started each one separately. To be fixed.
